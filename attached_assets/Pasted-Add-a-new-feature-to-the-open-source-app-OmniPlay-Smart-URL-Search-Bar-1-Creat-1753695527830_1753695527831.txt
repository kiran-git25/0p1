### üß≠ Smart URL Search Bar

1. Create a **search/input bar** at the top of the UI that accepts:
   - **YouTube links** (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123)
   - **Direct links to files** (e.g., https://example.com/file.pdf)
   - Optional: internal file reference (local file loaded earlier)

2. Based on the URL:
   - If it's a YouTube link, extract the video ID and embed it using an `<iframe>`:
     - Use YouTube's official embed format: `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID`
     - Use options like `modestbranding=1`, `rel=0`, `controls=1`
     - Show a disclaimer:
       > "Note: This video is streamed via YouTube's public embed player. Ads may still appear unless you use YouTube Premium."
     - Do **not** use any service or method to bypass ads or download the stream.

   - If it's any other link:
     - Try to fetch or preview the file in a new viewer window
     - If CORS or MIME type is unsupported, show a fallback message
     - Never store, cache, or track the URL

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal, Copyright & Licensing Compliance

1. **Respect all third-party content licenses:**
   - Do not use any proprietary or unlicensed code
   - Clearly mention any third-party libraries used in `LICENSE` and `README.md`
   - Use only MIT, Apache 2.0, or other open-source-compatible licensed tools

2. **Trademark & Branding:**
   - Do **not** use YouTube's logo, branding, or assets
   - Use plain text like ‚ÄúYouTube video‚Äù ‚Äî no icons, no logos
   - Do **not** represent OmniPlay as affiliated with Google, YouTube, Microsoft, Adobe, etc.

3. **Privacy and User Rights:**
   - Never track user behavior
   - Do not save search history or usage analytics
   - Clearly state in a `PRIVACY.md` or `README.md`:
     > ‚ÄúOmniPlay is a privacy-first app. All file handling and video playback occur entirely in the user‚Äôs browser. No data is sent to any server.‚Äù

4. **Add UI disclaimers when necessary**, for example:
   > ‚ÄúYou are responsible for complying with copyright laws when using OmniPlay. Do not open, play, or share content you do not own or have rights to.‚Äù
