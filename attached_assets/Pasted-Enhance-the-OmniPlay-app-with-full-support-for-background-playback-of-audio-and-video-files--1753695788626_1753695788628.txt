Enhance the OmniPlay app with full support for **background playback of audio and video files**.

---

### 🎧 Background Media Playback

1. Enable **audio and video playback to continue when:**
   - User switches tabs
   - User minimizes the browser or mobile PWA
   - App is in Electron background (desktop)

2. Ensure the media player:
   - Does **not pause automatically** due to visibility changes (`visibilitychange` event)
   - Works on **mobile browsers** (must be triggered by user interaction to comply with autoplay policies)

3. Add a **persistent media player** component:
   - That remains active even when file viewer is closed
   - Optionally display a **mini-player** in a fixed location (e.g., bottom-right)

### 🎮 Audio & Video Controls (Required Features)

1. Add a modern control panel with:
   - ▶️ Play / ⏸ Pause
   - ⏮ Rewind / ⏭ Forward
   - 🔊 Volume control (with mute toggle)
   - 🕓 Seek bar with current time / total duration
   - 🔁 Loop toggle
   - 🐢 Speed control (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x)

2. Ensure the UI is:
   - Touch-friendly (mobile support)
   - Keyboard-accessible (tab, spacebar, arrows)
   - Clean, minimal, no animations

3. Optional: Add a **“Now Playing” dock or bar** for better multitasking UI.

### ⚙️ Technical Details

1. Use the standard `<audio>` and `<video>` elements with `controlsList` and `autoplay` managed via user input
2. Use the `Page Visibility API` to detect tab changes but **do not pause** media on blur
3. Keep media playback modular — include:
   - `AudioPlayer.jsx` or `AudioController.js`
   - `VideoPlayer.jsx` with full control overlay
4. Respect browser limitations: autoplay only after explicit user interaction

### 🔐 Privacy & Performance Notes

- Playback must remain client-side
- No streaming or tracking
- Do not cache or persist media in storage

### ✅ Output Files

- Add new components:
  - `PersistentAudioPlayer.jsx`
  - `VideoControls.jsx`
  - `MiniPlayer.jsx` (optional)
- Update the global layout to support background-running components
- Document usage in `README.md` under “Background Playback”
